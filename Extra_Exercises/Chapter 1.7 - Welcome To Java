1.7 A Simple Java Program (Listing 1.1 and 1.2:

A Java program is executed from the main method in the class.
Letâ€™s begin with a simple Java program that displays the message Welcome to Java!
on the console. (The word console is an old computer term that refers to the text entry and
display device of a computer. Console input means to receive input from the keyboard, and
console output means to display output on the monitor.)
